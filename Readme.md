I have a cold garage, part of which I would like to be able to use as an office. It is not feasible for me to insulate the walls, roof and garage roll up door, so I thought I would partition off half and see if that would be easier to insulate.

then I came across the <a href="http://nook.do/">Nook</a>. I thought, that's a great idea, but I cant afford to spend that sort of money, so I set about designing one myself.

As I have already started the partition wall in my garage, I just needed to do the other two sides and a roof, and then I would have my very own custom designed Nook.

First I needed to set some requirements. it would need:
  * Designed for a single person
  * Somewhere I can do software development and writing in a nice quiet, comfortable environment
  * Insulated to retain heat (so that I'm not trying to heat my whole garage
  * needs to Fit 2 x 51 cm wide Monitors side by side
  * have enough Power sockets
  * Ethernet Switch (for wired internet)
  * Wifi (for my android devices)
  * room for my Swivel Chair

I decided that as I was heating the interior of my nook, I would put my PC's outside on shelves so that they would remain cooler. I may change this as the heat they generate may be useful for heating the nook.
