I have a cold garage, part of which I would like to be able to use as an office. It is not feasible for me to insulate the walls, roof and garage roll up door, so I thought I would partition off half and see if that would be easier to insulate.

then I came across the <a href="http://nook.do/">Nook</a>. I thought, that's a great idea, but I cant afford to spend that sort of money, so I set about designing one myself.

As I have already started the partition wall in my garage, I just needed to do the other two sides and a roof, and then I would have my very own custom designed Nook.

First I needed to set some requirements. it would need:
	* Designed for a single person
	* Somewhere I can do software development and writing in a nice quiet, comfortable environment
	* to Fit 2 x 51 cm wide Monitors side by side
	* Power sockets
	* Ethernet Switch (for wired internet)
	* Wifi (for my android devices)
	* room for my Swivel Chair

I then measured my current desk
	* desk is 72 cm high
	* Desk to monitor is 20cm
